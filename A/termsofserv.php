						<span>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>PAYMENT METHODS</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>DEBIT AND CREDIT cards</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						We accept most major debit and credit cards for payments up to £5000 (incl. vat), provided that the card and delivery address are the same, and that your payment has been authorized through 3D Secure – this is the “Verified by Visa” or “MasterCard Secure Code” process. If you wish us to deliver to an address that is not the card address, then our payment limit is £2000 (incl. vat). In either case, we reserve a discretionary right to ask for additional proof of identification. Sorry if this seems a little unfriendly, but we are obliged to follow on-line fraud protection advice.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>BANK TRANSFER</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						We can accept payment by BACS, CHAPS, IBAN or SWIFT. Our bank details are on our invoice, and can be sent separately to you upon request. This is the best method for paying larger amounts.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>ACCOUNTS</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						We would be pleased to receive 30-day credit account applications from commercial bodies. Please contact us on 020 8995 4664 or enquiries@StreamAlley.co.uk for an application form.
